# 🏎️ Multiplayer Car Racing Game  

## 🌟 Overview  
The **Multiplayer Car Racing Game** is an exciting and interactive two-player racing project created using Python.  
Two cars — **Red and Blue** — compete to reach the finish line first on a custom-designed track.  
This project demonstrates real-time movement, event handling, and simple animation — perfect for beginners exploring Python-based game logic.

## 🔧 Technology Used  
🐍 **Python** – For game logic and control  
🖼️ **GIF Images** – Used for cars, race track, and win screens

## 🛠 How It Works  
1️⃣ Two cars (Red and Blue) are placed on the race track.  
2️⃣ Players use keyboard controls to move:  
   - 🟥 **Red Car** → `Up Arrow (↑)`  
   - 🟦 **Blue Car** → `W` key  
3️⃣ The cars move upward as players press their keys.  
4️⃣ The first car to reach the finish line triggers a winner screen.
